# sensor_actuator_emulator
This repository contains various codes for building and testing a FPGA-based Sensor-Actuator Emulation System for digital control applications. It includes VHDL modules to construct and simulate essential sensor and actuator behavior, Python scripts to convert CSV data to VHDL LUTs and to analyze streamed IMU data against reference CSVs, a PlatformIO project to test the Adafruit library for the ICM-20948 IMU sensor, and an STM32CubeIDE project for the Nucleo-L432KC board to verify I2C and SPI communication with the emulated IMU. Together, these tools support a full workflow for developing, simulating, and validating sensor-actuator systems in embedded and control-oriented environments.
